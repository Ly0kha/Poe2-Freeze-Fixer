# POE2CrashFixer

**POE2CrashFixer** is a tool to fix freezing issues in **Path of Exile 2** caused by the **Windows 24H2 update** and **AMD X3D CPUs**. The freezes happen during loading screens and can lock up your system. This tool dynamically adjusts CPU core usage to prevent these crashes.

## Example Logs

**During loading**:
[INFO] Detected 16 CPU cores. [INFO] PathOfExileSteam.exe process found. [INFO] Loading detected. Parking cores -> allowed cores: [0, 1, 2, 3]


**After loading**:
[INFO] Loading complete. Restoring all cores -> allowed cores: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

## Troubleshooting

1. **Run as Administrator**:
   - The tool needs Administrator permissions to change CPU settings.

2. **Log file not found**:
   - Ensure the game has a `logs/client.txt` file.
   - Restart the game if the file doesnâ€™t exist.

3. **Python not installed**:
   - Run `install.bat` to ensure Python and all dependencies are installed.
